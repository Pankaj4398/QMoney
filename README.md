QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.

During this Micro-Experience, I:

    Implemented the core logic of the portfolio manager and published it as a library.

    Refactored code to add support for multiple stock quote services.

    Improved application stability and performance.
